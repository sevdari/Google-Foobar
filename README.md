# Google Foobar

Now that the Google Foobar challenge is retired (rip), I believe it consistutes no issue if I am to post my solutions to the challenge. In the future (whenever that it is), I will try to clean my code and use my notes to provide a brief description for each challenge. 

The original link https://foobar.withgoogle.com/ now points to the Google Careers site.
